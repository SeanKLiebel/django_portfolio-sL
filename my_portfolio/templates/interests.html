            <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am a guy who stays indoors but loves to go sledding. During the warmer months here in New York, I enjoy running, reading, and kayaking.</p>
            <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and comedy movies, I am an avid learner, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end and backend web development worlds.</p>
